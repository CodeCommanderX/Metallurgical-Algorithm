# Simulated Annealing Algorithm

## Introduction

The Simulated Annealing algorithm, also known as the Hill Climbing algorithm, is a technique used to optimize complex search algorithms. It is employed to find algorithms with the best chance of performing well, even if they may not be guaranteed to be the best solution. Simulated Annealing is widely used in computer science and mathematical optimization.

## Motivation

With hill climbing methods not ensuring global optimization, Simulated Annealing introduces a probabilistic method to escape local optima. By starting with a high temperature and gradually "cooling" it down with continuous iterations, the algorithm can accept worse solutions with high frequency. 

## Algorithm Overview

Simulated Annealing is a mathematical and modeling method commonly used to aid in finding a global optimum in a specific function or problem. Named after the slow cooling process of metals, it applies this concept to data domains.

### Pseudocode

```python
function SIMULATED-ANNEALING(problem, schedule) returns a solution state
inputs: problem, a problem
        schedule, a mapping from time to "temperature"
local variables: T, a "temperature" controlling the probability of downward steps
current <- MAKE-NODE(problem.INITIAL-STATE)
for t = 1 to ∞ do
    T <- schedule(t)
    if T = 0 then return current
    next <- a randomly selected successor of current
    ∆E <- next.VALUE - current.VALUE
    if ∆E > 0 then current <- next
    else current <- next only with probability e^(∆E/T)
```
